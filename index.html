  <h2><b>Company History and Story</b></h2>
  <br>
  <h3>The first NCAA Division I men’s basketball tournament was in 1939 and in 1939, the Oregon Ducks went 29-5 on the season and beat Ohio State 46-33 to win the 
    national title in the first NCAA tournament. The 1939 tournament featured just eight teams. In 1951, the field doubled to 16, and kept expanding over the next 
    few decades until 1985, when the modern format of a 64-team tournament began. In 2001, after the Mountain West Conference joined Division I and received an 
    automatic bid, pushing the total teams to 65, a single game was added prior to the first round. In 2011, three more teams were added, and with them, three 
    more games to round out the First Four.</h3>

  <h2><b>Management Team</b></h2>
  <br>
  <h3>{<u>Gonzaga Bulldogs</u>:The best team in college basketball this season -- and in many seasons.
  <br>    
      <u>Baylor Bears</u>: A team that's almost completely fallen back into its groove of dominance. 
   <br>
      <u>Michigan Wolverines</u>: A skillfully coached team that was faded hard by many and predicted to fall prior to the Elite Eight 
      but has nonetheless averaged 81.3 points without its best player (Isaiah Livers) and separated from all of its opponents 
      by the 10-minute mark of the second half.
   <br>
      <u>USC Trojans</u>: An overlooked team finally getting its respect. USC has won its three games by 64 points, which is the second-largest 
      aggregate margin of victory by any seed No. 6 or worse in history. Listen, my bracket is sort of a shambles. 
   <br>
      <u>Houston Cougars</u>: The No. 3-ranked team at KenPom get a little bit lucky but also exert its will on teams. 
   <br>
      <u>UCLA Bruins</u>: A revival of a blue blood. UCLA's 88-78 win over Alabama Sunday night at Hinkle was a game I'd rank in the top three of 
      the tournament.
   <br>
      <u>Arkansas Razorbacks</u>: The  team that's had the shakiest way to get to this point. The Razorbacks beat TTU and Oral Roberts by two points 
      apiece and would no longer be in the field had Max Abmas' 3-point attempt been two inches to the right. But it wasn't, and Arkansas is 
      still dancing.
   <br>
      <u>Oregon State Beavers</u>: One of the most unlikely regional-final runs from a power-conference team in history.}</h3>
